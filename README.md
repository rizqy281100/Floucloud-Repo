This is a website app project on one of Telkomsigma Unit Division - Flocloud. This web is for admin only to manage data regarding contents, user/admin data, send notifications to the mobile app, while the mobile app is for the users to access the content upload by the admin and receive notifications. This project is for interal use only - meaning it will be used only for the Floucloud unit division only.

Me and my partner also received help from the Flocloud team to develop the project faster. This website application is developed using codeigniter 3 and MySQL as the database. And the API development is using codeigniter 4 to make it easier since codeigniter 3 do not have API.
